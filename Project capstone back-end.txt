Project capstone back-end:

Scenario:

The owners of the Little Lemon restaurant have hired you to build two APIs. 
One API to order food using the Menu API. 
You need to build the Table booking API to facilitate reserving a table for dining in the 
restaurant on a 
specific date and for a certain number of people.
